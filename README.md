# TheSun
 This program involves taking user input and implementing the position of the sun based on the user's current location, date, and time.
## The Features
1. Input Latitude, Longitude, Date then Press [Calcualte](#) to get the output data.
2. Press [Random](#) to generate and calculate a random Sun Data.


## The Installation

1. Launch the program directly on web using [itch](itch.io) to install foobar.
2. If you want to download an .exe file, access [itch](itch.io), scroll down and find the Download Now button.

## The Input And Output
### Requirements Input
    Lattitude, Longitude, Valid DateTime.
### Output
1. Sun Elevation Angle (α): Measures the Sun's height relative to the horizon line. For example, if the Sun is at zenith, this Angle will be 90 degrees.
